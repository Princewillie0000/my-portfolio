        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="tracking-wider text-lg font-sans font-light">
        My journey in software development began during my time at Aptech
        Computer Education, where I led numerous projects and was honored as the
        best graduating student upon graduation. Though my mom once envisioned a
        career in neurosurgery for me, I found my true passion in programming,
        and I haven't looked back since.
        <p className="tracking-wider text-lg font-sans mt-6">
          I believe in giving your best and doing what you love, and this
          website is my way of sharing my journey, learning experiences, and fun
          projects with a broader audienceâ€”not just tech enthusiasts but anyone
          interested in creativity and innovation. What sets me apart is my
          curiosity and adaptability, as I continuously explore new technologies
          and ideas, with a particular excitement for the potential of AI. My
          long-term goal is to develop a SaaS product or business that solves
          real-world problems for the masses. In my downtime, you'll find me
          reading, enjoying a good nap, or creating videos that I may or may not
          share online. I hope this space leaves you feeling impressed and
          perhaps even thinking, "I have to hire this guy!"!.
