        <bold className=" font-bold"> Full Stack Web Developer</bold>, my
        approach to software development is often shaped by my love for
        problem-solving. Though I tend to break down challenges into manageable
        pieces, the overwhelming nature of some tasks can make this difficult. I
        find immense joy in working on projects that not only spark my curiosity
        but also contribute to real-world solutions. Whether it’s through
        building with Next.js or crafting side projects, I’m always striving to
        improve my skills and make a tangible impact. The milestones I achieve,
        especially when seeing my work benefit real users, keep me motivated.
