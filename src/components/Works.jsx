        I currently work as a{" "}
        <i className=" font-bold"> Full Stack Web Developer</i>, my approach to
        software development is often shaped by my love for problem-solving.
        Though I tend to break down challenges into manageable pieces, the
        overwhelming nature of some tasks can make this difficult. I find
        immense joy in working on projects that not only spark my curiosity but
        also contribute to real-world solutions. Whether it’s through building
        with Next.js or crafting side projects, I’m always striving to improve
        my skills and make a tangible impact. The milestones I achieve,
        especially when seeing my work benefit real users, keep me motivated.
